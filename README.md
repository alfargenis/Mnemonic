## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to clone and install the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    npm i mnemonic-alf
    ```

2.  **Start the application**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

`npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cant go back!

If you arent satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you re on your own.

You dont have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnt feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldnt be useful if you couldnt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment Scripts

To deploy the application, you can use the following scripts:

`npm run predeploy`

This script runs automatically before deploy to build the application.

`npm run deploy`

This script deploys the application using GitHub Pages. Make sure you have properly configured the repository to use GitHub Pages.
